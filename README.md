# Assignment Solutions by [Larry Madeo](https://twitter.com/larmalade)

**Welcome to Webstack Basics!**

This repository contains my assignment solutions from the 2nd year programming 
track at [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com).

**Whats in here?**

Each folder in this repo contains code I created as I progressed through the
2nd half of theHolberton program. These folders contain assignments on given topics,
each with different specifications.  These are small scale assignments, each folder
with a one day timeline for completion. As such, the programs here are samples
of my work as time progressed. If you are interested in my work on larger-scale
projects, see some of my other repositories:
